    "### 1.1 Real Life Problem\n",
    "Customer churn is a major concern for telecommunication companies, as acquiring new customers is significantly more expensive than retaining existing ones. Many telecommunications providers aim to identify customers who are likely to stop using their mobile network so that proactive retention strategies can be applied.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Invested stakeholders\n",
    "The primary stakeholders of this project include SyriaTel’s business management, marketing and retention teams, customer service departments, and strategic decision-makers who are interested in reducing customer churn and improving long-term customer loyalty."

    "### 2.1 Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "SyriaTel is experiencing customer attrition and wants to reduce churn by identifying at-risk customers early.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SyriaTel lacks a data-driven method to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Predict which customers are likely to churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Determine the estimated revenue at risk from customers who churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Understand the key factors driving customer dissatisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Business Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Can we accurately predict whether a customer will churn? \n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the estimated revenue at risk from customers who churn?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Which customer behaviors and service features are most strongly associated with churn?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Business Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Build a classification model to predict customer churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Estimate the potential revenue at risk when customers churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Identify key factors associated with customer churn and retention to support data-driven decision-making.\n",

    "\n",
    "The findings of this project will help SyriaTel to: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify at-risk customers early, enabling proactive retention strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Understand the potential revenue impact of customer churn and prioritize high-risk, high-value customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Gain insights into customer behaviors and service factors that influence churn, supporting targeted improvements in service quality and customer satisfaction."

    "### 3.1 Data Description and Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The dataset contains customer-level data from SyriaTel. Each row represents a single customer. This dataset is suitable for the project because it includes usage metrics, service plans, and customer service interactions which are key indicators of customer behavior and satisfaction. These variables provide meaningful insights into how customers use the mobile network, the types of services they subscribe to, and the level of support they require—all of which are closely linked to churn behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ This dataset was sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/becksddf/churn-in-telecoms-dataset?resource=download). Kaggle is an online platform for data science and machine learning that allows users to learn, practice, and collaborate using real-world data and problems.\n",

    "+ This dataset contains 21 feature columns and 3333 customer records.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Target Variable\n",
    "\n",
    " **- Churn (Boolean) -** Indicates whether a customer has discontinued service with the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ True → Customer is likely to leave the service\n",
    "\n",
    "+ False → Customer is likely to remain\n",

    "#### A. Customer Usage - These features capture how customers use the service.\n",

    "+ total intl minutes – total international call duration\n",
    "\n",
    "+ total intl calls – total number of international calls\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "+ international plan – whether the customer has an international calling plan\n",
    "\n",
    "+ voice mail plan – whether voicemail plan is subscribed\n",
    "\n",
    "+ number of voice mail messages\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### C. Customer Support - This is often a strong indicator of dissatisfaction, as customers typically contact customer service when they experience problems with the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ number of customer service calls\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### D. Administrative Features\n",
    "\n",
    "+ state – the state/region where the customer lives\n",
    "\n",
    "+ account length – time (in days) the customer has had the account\n",
    "\n",
    "+ area code – geographic telephone area code\n",
